          <h1>Favourite Animal: Cat</h1>
      
        
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:white;"><h2>Introduction:</h2> The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. 
                Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.
                 It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. 
                 It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals.
                  It also secretes and perceives pheromones. Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. 
                  Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.</div>
            <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:white;"> <h2>Evolution:</h2> The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10 to 15 million years ago.[24]
                 The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago.[25] Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 6.46 to 16.76 million years ago.[26] 
                 The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago.[25] Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[27]
                  The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes[28] and roughly 20,000 genes.[29]</div>
            <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:white;"><h2> Habitat:</h2> The domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world.[46] It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated Kerguelen Islands.[178][179]
                 Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species.[180] It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants.[181] Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.[182]
                 The unwantedness that leads to the domestic cat being treated as an invasive species is twofold. On one hand, as it is little altered from the wildcat, it can readily interbreed with the wildcat. This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary, 
                 possibly also the Iberian Peninsula, and where protected natural areas are close to human-dominated landscapes, such as Kruger National Park in South Africa.[183][43] However, its introduction to places where no native felines are present also contributes to the decline of native species.[184]</div>
